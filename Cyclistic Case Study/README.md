# Cyclistic-Case-Studies
The Cyclistic Case Study explores how members and casual riders use this bike-share service differently. 

The Cyclistic_Case_Study.pdf contains all the steps necessary in the data analysis process. 

The data cleansing and analysis portion of the case study is documented in detail in the Cyclistic_Data_Cleaning_Documentation.pdf file. 

The visualization is linked in the Case_Study.pdf file but it needs to be downloaded for the user to click on the link. Therefore, I have added the link to the Tableau Public visualization here in order to copy and paste the link with ease.
